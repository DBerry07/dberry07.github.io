My name is David Berry and I am a junior-level software engineer.
I specialize in native Android app development with Kotlin, though I also have some personal experience with Flutter and Dart and additional professional experience in Java.

## <u>Work Experience</u>


#### <b>Bank of America</b> (Contract)<br> May 2021 - May 2022

#### <b>Revature Training</b> (Contract)<br> Jan 2020 - Sept 2020
I completed an eleven week Revature training camp in Tampa, Florida. Here, I was taught how to develop native Android applications.<br>
I made two apps during this time: [MaintainX](/posts/maintainx) and [CaliberDroid](/posts/caliber-droid) (both of which are listed on this website under the "Revature" category).<br>
After the training was completed, we had just started the COVID-19 lockdown. While I was preparing for a position at Accenture, the contract was cancelled due to the lockdown.<br>
I remained on standby for the next while but no new contracts were put forward.<br>
Though the initial Revature contract was for three years, Revature and I amicably terminated my contract because of the lockdown (and the lack of work).

## <u>Education</u>
#### Florida Atlantic University (Graduated May 2019): Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science <br>
