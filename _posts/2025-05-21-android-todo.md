### Overview:
SimpleTodoList is a native Android application coded in Kotlin with Firebase Firestore integration. The application allows the user to create a task, edit a task, delete a task, and mark a task as completed. These tasks appear in lists ("Uncompleted" and "Completed") on the main page. 
The application also features a "priority" labeling, allowing the user to label a task in one of four priorities - Normal, Low, Medium, and High. Depending on whether the user has marked a task as "completed", the task appears in either the "Uncompleted" list or "Completed" list.

The app also has sort and filter functions: the user can sort the list based on task ID numbers and sort on the tasks' priority; likewise, the user can use a filter to show only tasks that match the a specific priority.

Currently, the app only supports one login that is shared between all users.

### Technologies Used:
+ Kotlin
+ Firebase Firestore
+ Jetpack Compose
+ MVVM Design Pattern
+ Android Studio
+ Android SDK

### Future Plans:
+ Allow user-created lists, besides just the "Completed" and "Uncompleted" lists.
+ Allow the user to add alarms and reminders to tasks.
+ Allow users to login based on personal username and password, to show only tasks created by them.
+ Allow users to share a task with another user.
